# RANG.TV

RANG.TV is a Spring Boot application that is yet another reddit.tv clone that I developed to replace the countless other clones that have come and gone over the years.  I found what happened was most of these clones eventually stop working for whatever reason (Reddit changes their APIs, domains expire, certificates expire, etc) and the developers understandably don't update their clients to address these issues as I don't think they get much traffic and they definitely don't make any money of of them.

A lot of these clones are open source but rather than attempting to fix existing clones I instead decided to create my own with the goal of making it as easy as possible to maintain going forward.
